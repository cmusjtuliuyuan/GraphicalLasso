``Emalgorithm.py''
This algorithm is an EM Algorithm for Confounded Heterogenous Data
		y \sim X\beta +Zu+\epsilon
		u \sim N(0, I \sigma_u^2)
		Y \sim N(X\beta, ZZ^T \epsilon_\sigma^2 + I \sigma_u^2)
You can test it by python Emalgorithm_run.py

``GoWild'' is the code for problem1.3

``GraphicalLass.py'' is based on the paper:
		Sparse inverse covariance estimation with the graphical lasso
You can run it by python GraphicalLasso.py




``Kronecker_product_one.py'' contains the function used in problem 2.2.3.
	the input of function get_GL_condition(c) is c, it well return the value of
